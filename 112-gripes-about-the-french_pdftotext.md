# 112 Gripes about the French

## Foreword

Americans believe in the right to criticize. We defend our right to "beef" or
"gripe" or "sound off". We insist upon the right to express our own opinions.

But we also believe in the right of others to express their opinions. For the
right to speak involves the duty to listen. The right to criticize involves the
responsibility of giving "the other side" a fair chance to make its point. We
know that the truth can only be found through open and honest discussion, and
that the common good is served through common attempts to reach common
understanding. In one way, Democracy is the long and sometimes difficult effort
which free men make to understand each other.

This booklet tries to help some of us understand an ally — the French . It is
not meant either to "defend" the French or to chastise those Americans who do
not like the French. It is intended simply to bring into reasonable focus those
irritations, dissatisfactions and misunderstandings which arise because it is
often hard for the people of one country to understand the people of another.

The booklet uses the Question-Answer form. It lists the criticisms,
misconceptions and ordinary "gripes" which American troops in Europe express
most frequently when they talk about the French. Each comment, or question, is
followed by an answer — or discussion. Some of the answers are quite short,
because the question is direct and simple. Some of the answers are quite long,
because the "questions" are not questions at all, but indictments which contain
complicated and sweeping preconceptions.

The purpose of the present publication is this: to present facts and judgements
which even the well-intentioned may tend to overlook.

There may be those who will consider this booklet a catalogue of "excuses" or
"justifications". To them it can only be said that the truth is not denied by
giving it a derogatory label.

There may be others who will seize upon the questinos with triumph — ignoring
the disscussions entirely. That kind of reader will ignore the truth anyway —
in whatever form it is offered.

This booklet may not convince those who are hopelessly prejudiced, but it may
help to keep others from being infected by the same lamentable virus.

## the French AND US

<div id="1"><em>1. "We came to Europe twice in twnty-five years to save the French."</em></div>

We didn't come to Europe to save the French, either in 1917 or in 1944. We
didn't come to Europe to do anyone any favors. We came to Europe because we in
America were threatened by a hostile, aggressive and very dangerous power.

In this war, France fell in June of 1940. We didn't invade Europe until June of
1944. We didn't even think of "saving the French" through military action until
after Pearl Harbor — after the Germans declared war on us.

We came to Europe, in two wars, because it was better to fight our enemy in
Europe than in America. Would it have been smarter to fight the Battle of the
Bulge in Ohio? Would it have been smarter if D-Day had meant a hop across the
Atlantic Ocean, instead of the English Channel, in order to get at an enemy
sending rocket bombs crashing into our homes? Would it have been smart to wait
in America until V bombs, buzz bombs, rocket bombs, and — perhaps — atomic bombs
had made shambles of our cities? Even the kids in Germany sang this song:
"Today Germany, tomorrow the world." We were a part of that world. We were
marked for conquest.

When France fell, _our_ last defense on the Continent was gone. France was the
"keystone of freedom" on land from the Mediterranean to the North Sea; it was a
bulwark against German aggression. France guarded the Atlantic, and the bases
the Germans needed on the Atlantic for submarine and air warfare.

American security and American foreign policy have always rested on this hard
fact: we cannot permit a hostile power on the Atlantic Ocean. We cannot be
secure if we are threatened on the Atlantic. That's why we went to war in 1917;
that's why we had to fight in 1944. And that's why, as a matter of common sense
and the national interest, President Roosevelt declared (November 11, 1941):
"The defense of any territory under the control of the "French Volunteer Forces
(the Free French) is vital to the defense of the United States."


<div id="2"><em>2. "At first, when we came into Normandy, and then into Paris, the French gave us everything — wine, cheese, fruit, everything. They threw their arms around us and kissed us every time we turned around. They gave us the biggest welcome you ever saw. But they've forgotten. They're ungrateful."</em></div>

Perhaps the French ran out of wine, cheese, fruit and cognac to pass out free.
Perhaps the French depleted the stocks they had hidden in their cellars from
the Germans.

Could not a Frenchman who read the question above ask, "Are the Americans so
ungrateful? Have they so soon forgotten how much we gave them from what little
we had?"

<div id="3"><em>3. "The French don't invite us into their homes."</em></div>

They don't have the food. (The Germans took it.)

They don't speak English and we don't speak French. It's hard to extend
hospitality under those conditions.

Ask those soldiers who _have_ been invited into a French home what it was like.

How many American homes were you invited into when you were stationed near a
"soldier town" in the States?

<div id="4"><em>4. "The French rub me the wrong way."</em></div>

It was inevitable that some Frenchmen would rub some Americans the wrong way.
City people often rub country folk the wrong way; the same goes for a
Pittsburgher in New Orleans, or a Texan on Fifth Avenue.

We Americans believe in the value of differences — if basic political beliefs
and goals rest on a common foundation. (See [question § 69](#69).)

"Unless you bear with the faults of a friend you betray your own."

<div id="5"><em>5. "I'll never love the french." "I hate the French!"</em></div>

You don't have to love the French. You don't have to hate them either. You
might try to understand them.

The more important point is not to let your feeling blind you to the fact that
they were and are our _allies_. They were in 1917, too.

The most important question any people can ask itself is this: "Who fights with
us? Who fights against us?"

<div id="6"><em>6. "We're always pulling the French out of a jam. Did they ever do anything for us?"</em></div>

They did. They helped us out of one of the greatest jams we were ever in.
During the American revolution, when almost the entire world stood by in
"non intervention" or was against us, it was France who was our greatest ally
and benefactor. France loaned the thirteen states $ 6,000,000 — and _gave_ us
over $3,000,000 more. (That was a lot more money in those days than it is now.)

45,000 Frenchmen volunteered in the army of George Washington. They crossed the
Atlantic Ocean in small boats that took two months to make the voyage.

Washington's army had no military engineers; it was French engineers who
designed and built our fortifications.

The name of Lafayette is one that Americans will never forget, and the French
are as proud of that name as we are.

You can judge the measure and meaning of French aid to our Revolution from the
letter George Washington sent on April 9, 1781 to our military envoy in Paris,
asking for help from France:

"We are at this hour suspended in the balance; not from choice but from hard
and absolute necessity… Our troops are fast approaching nakedness… our
hospitals are without medicines and our sick without nutrition… in a word, we
are at the end of our tether, and… now or never our deliverance must come."

It was France that came to our aid in our darkest hour.


<div id="7"><em>7. "We can't rely on these French."</em></div>

That depends on what you mean by "rely". If you expect the French to react like
Americans, you will be disappointed. They are not Americans; they are French.
If you expect the French to hurry the way we do, you will be disappointed; the
French don't hurry — neither do most of the people in the world outside of
America.

But we _were_ able to rely on the French for the most important thing: France
fought with us, not against us, twice in the past two decades.

<div id="8"><em>8. "We've had more beefing from the French than from the Germans. We are always quarreling with them. They criticize everything. They have to put their two cents in. But the Germans — they just do what you tell them to. They're co-operative; the French aren't."</em></div>

Two men working together are more likely to tell each other off than a prisoner
is to tell off the warden.

Of course we differ with the French; of course we argue with them. Why?
Because we have a common goal and face common problems. Because we, like the
French, have been taught to think for ourselves, to "put our two cents in".
Democracy is based on the idea that everyone has a basic right to "put his
two cents in" . In America we say, "I'm from Missouri" or "Sez who?"
The French have the'same attitude; they say, _"Je ne crois qu ce que je vois"_.
("I only believe what I see.") Or _"Je ne demande pas mieux que d'être convaincu"_
("I don't ask much; I just want to be convinced.")

There is a saying that in France everything is permitted that is not strictly
forbidden — but in Germany every thing is _verboten_ that is not strictly
permitted. We are in the French, not the German, tradition.

Yes, we quarrel with the French. The members of a family argue pretty freely
inside the home. We quarrel with our _allies_. We don't quarrel with our
enemies — we fight them.

As for the Germans, they've _got_ to be "co-operative". They have no choice.
They're under military law.

Which is better: a critical ally or a fawning enemy?

"Flatterers are the worst kind of enemies." — Tacitus.

<div id="9"><em>9. "We gave the French uniforms, jeeps, trucks, supplies, ammunition — everything."</em></div>

We didn't give the French these things. We _lent_ them, under Lend-Lease, a
law passed by our Congress as "An Act to Promote the Defense of the United
States". We lent military equipment and supplies to our _ally_.

Where else could the French have gotten uniforms, guns, ammunition, supplies?
From the Germans?

A Frenchman armed with an 03 rifle could kill Germans. It was wiser for us to
turn out weapons and uniforms to arm the French than to turn out additional
American soldiers.

<div id="10"><em>10. "We gave the French billions of dollars worth of stuff. They'll never pay it back."</em></div>

Under Lend-Lease we provided military supplies and equipment to France worth
$1,041,000,000.

Under reverse Lend-Lease, the French have already paid back about $450,000,000
— almost half of the amount we lent them in the way of military supplies.

The French paid this $450,000,000 back in the same way that they got it from
us — with supplies, materials, food, labor, services.

Here are some of the things the French have provided us:

- 131,000 snow capes for the winter campaign of 1944.
- 700 tons of rubber tires, made in France.
- 260,000 signs and posters for road markers during the military campaign.
- Millions of jerricans.
- 150,000 French workmen and civilians, working for the United States Army and
  paid by the French government. These French men and women work at airfields,
  railway yards, ports, docks, in offices, etc. They range from stevedores to
  nurses, mechanics to typists, in France, North Africa, and the French islands
  in the South Pacific, such as New Caledonia, where American troops are
  stationed.
- All French telephone and telegraph services were placed at our disposal.
- Lumber, cement, gravel for construction purposes.
- Billets — all through France, from Brest to Strasbourg, from Paris to Nice or
  Biarritz.
- Theaters such as the Olympia, the Empire, the Marignan in Paris.
- Restaurants — for American mess halls.
- Food — though the French are very short of it themselves. The French supply
  us with such fresh fruit and vegetables as can be spared.
- Beer — made in France, by the French, for American troops, from ingredients
  shipped from the United States.
- Printing — Stars and Stripes, Yank, Army Talks, Overseas Woman, I and E
  pamphlets.

<div id="11"><em>11. "The French are using our gas, but they won't give it to Americans. You can't get gas in the French zones of occupation if you're driving through."</em></div>

You are not supposed to.

The French are given gasoline by U.S. Army authority. It is the only gasoline
they get. They are compelled to use it for themselves.

The Reciprocal Aid Agreement, under Lend-Lease laws, states (Article III) that
the Government of France will not, without the consent of the President of the
U.S., transfer any articles provided the French, or permit their use, by anyone
not an officer, employee, or agent of the French government.

Can an American gas pump give gasoline to a French army car which is not
specifically authorized to obtain gasoline from an American pump? If you were
on duty would you give gasoline to unauthorized persons?

<div id="12"><em>12. "One Frenchman told me the French practically gave us the Statue of Liberty. How do you like that?"</em></div>

The Statue of Liberty began as the idea of a group of Frenchmen, shortly after
the Civil War. They commissioned a French sculptor, Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi,
to do the work. A committee of Frenchmen was formed in 1874 to raise funds.
Bartholdi recommended the site for the statue — Bedloe's Island in New York
harbor.

In France, 180 French cities, forty general councils, and thousands of
anonymous Frenchmen contributed a quarter of a million dollars (not francs)
towards the statue. (The United States raised $280,000.) In 1883, the President
of the French Committee, Mr. de Lesseps, officially presented the statue to
the American people.

<div id="13"><em>13. "We are not welcome in French Restaurants."</em></div>

Why should we be? We are supposed to eat in army messes. Every meal we might
eat in a French restaurant would use up just that much food, from the
Frenchmen's limited supply.

<div id="14"><em>14. "Every time we go into a night club, we get soaked by these Frenchmen."</em></div>

Were you never soaked in a night club at home? Compare the prices in Paris
night clubs to those in the night clubs you've visited in Miami or New York,
Chicago or Los Angeles.

A G.I. comes out of a night club in the States and says, "A buck and half for
a Scotch and soda! That place is a clip joint!" The sane G.I. comes out of a
night club in Paris and says "Ninety francs for a shot of cognac! That's
the French for you — they re all robbers!"

<div id="15"><em>15. "The French are terrible scroungers. They keep mooching candy, soap, cigarettes, food from the GIs. They have no self-respect."</em></div>

Some of the French are scroungers.
Hungry people lose their pride.
An empty stomach does not worry about losing face.

<div id="16"><em>16. "The French welcomed us at first;  now they want us to get out."</em></div>

An American GI recently said, "We're like people who were given a wonderful
reception for a week-end. But we've stayed in the house for a year. No one
wants a house guest that long."

Of course the French would prefer that American troops leave France as soon as
possible. (So would you, if you were a Frenchman.) As long as we are here, we
impose an added strain on the already overtaxed French economy. The French need
the billets and food and supplies and services which they are now supplying to
us. (See [question § 10](#10).)

<div id="17"><em>17. "The French brag a lot about the fighting they did, but you don't hear any Americans passing out bouquets to them."</em></div>

General Patton cabled General Koenig, the French commander of the FFI, that the
spectacular advance of his (Patton's) army across France would have been
impossible without the fighting aid of the FFI.

General Patch estimated that from the time of the Mediterranean landings to the
arrival of our troops at Dijon, the help given to our operations by the FFI was
equivalent to four full divisions.

The Maquis who defended the Massif Central, in the south-central part of
France, had two Nazi divisions stymied; they kept those two divisions from
fighting against us.

The magnificent fight the Free French put up at Bir Hakeim, in the Libyan
campaign, will be long remembered in the annals of heroism.

Perhaps some of us don't like to pass out bouquets — to anyone but ourselves.
Perhaps we have short memories.

<div id="18"><em>18. "The French let us down when the fighting got tough. What did they do — as fighters — to help us out?"</em></div>

Here are a few of the things the French did:

The French fought in Africa, in Sicily, liberated Corsica, fought in Italy,
took part in the invasion of Europe and fought through the battles of France
and Germany — from Normandy to Munich.

Units from the French navy participated in the invasions of Sicily, Italy,
Normandy and South France.

Units of the French navy and merchant marine took part in convoying operations
on the Atlantic and Murmansk routes.

On June 5, 1944, the day before D-Day, over 5,000 Frenchmen of the resistance
dynamited railroads in more than 500 strategic places.

They delayed strategic German troop movements for an average of 48 hours,
according to our military experts. Those 48 hours were tactically priceless;
they saved an untold number of American lives.

French resistance groups blew up a series of bridges in southern France and
delayed one of the Wehrmacht's crack units (Das Reich Panzer Division) for
_twelve days_ in getting from Bordeaux to Normandy.

About 30,000 FFI troups supported the Third Army's VIII Corps in Brittany:
they seized and held key spots; they conducted extensive guerrilla operations
behind the German lines.

25,000 FFI troops protected the south flank of the Third Army in its daring
dash across France; the FFI wiped out German bridgeheads north of the Loire
river; they guarded vital lines of communication; they wiped out pockets of
German resistance; they held many towns and cities under orders from our
command.

When our Third Army was approaching the area between Dijon and Troyes from the
west, and while the Seventh Army was approaching this sector from the South,
it was the FFI who stubbornly blocked the Germans from making a stand and
prevented a mass retirement of German troops.

In Paris, as our armies drew close, several hundred thousand French men and
women rose up against the Germans. 50,000 armed men of the resistance fought
and beat the Nazi garrison, and occupied the main buildings and administrative
offices of Paris.

These are some of the things the French did. For others, see [question § 104](#104).

<div id="18"><em>18. "They ride in our deeps and waste our gas"</em></div>

They ride in the jeeps which are officially loaned to them by our government.

How do you know they are wasting gas? How do you know their trips are not on
official business? Did no Americans waste gas on pleasure trips?

<div id="20"><em>20. "The French aren't friendly."</em></div>

Some Frenchmen are; other Frenchmen are not.

The French as a whole are not as "hail fellow well met" as we Americans are.
Neither are the British, the Swedes, the Greeks, the Mexicans.

Frenchmen don't get personal or confidential quickly.

They don't "open up" as quickly as we do in the States. The French are very
polite; they are also more formal than we are about personal relationships.
(So are the Chinese.) The French respect another person's privacy, and they
like to have their own privacy respected too.

It is natural for anyone to think the people of another nation are not as
friendly as his own people. It's hard to be friendly in a foreign language.
It's hard to be friendly when you're hungry, cold, and have gone through six
years of war — as the French have. Yet the Americans who came into Normandy,
or who came into Paris right after the liberation, still talk about the
astonishing outburst of gratitude, generosity and friendliness which the French
displayed toward us.

Back in the States, many of our troops complained that the people in the towns
near the training camps were not friendly. People from our South often complain
that the people in the North are not friendly. A Texan in Vermont finds
New Englanders "cold" and "snobbish". Do we then say that all Americans are
unfriendly?

Friendship, said a wise man, lies in this: "To desire the same things and to
reject the same things." On this basis, the United States has never had a
better friend than France. (See [question § 69](#69).)

<div id="21"><em>21. "Why bother about the French? They won't throw any weight in the post-war world."</em></div>

Apart from reasons of honor and simple decency (Americans are not in the habit
of letting their friends down), it is poor politics and worse diplomacy to
"write off" a nation of 40 million allies. You may need their help some day.

France still stands as a bastion on the Atlantic, from the Mediterranean to the
North Sea. France will still be a strong factor in world political
organization. The island bases of France, and its colonies, will still be
strategic areas in the world structure of peace. And in the age of the atomic
bomb, the physical size of a country may be no index of its strength and
potentialities.

Why bother about France? It is not our job to "bother about" France. But it is
our job to be seriously concerned about the peace and the political problems
of the world. France is very much a part of that world.

David Low, the English cartoonist, once drew a famous cartoon showing the
nations in a large rowboat. The European nations were at one end of the boat,
which was foundering in the water; Uncle Sam sat at the other end, high and dry
and out of the water. And Uncle Sam was saying, "Why should I worry? The leak
isn't in my end of the boat!" We have paid a terrible price for believing that
a leak "at the other end of the boat" does not affect our destiny.

### B. Customs and Manners

It is always something of a shock when you ran int o
different ways of talking, eating, doing things . But what
is different is not always inferior . "different " does not ,
mean "worse" . There is more than one way of skinnin g
a cat .
The story is told of an American soldier who saw som e
Chinese putting rice on the graves in a Chungking cemetery . That doesn't make sense", said the American wit h

A11 the French do is talk .

No nation could exist for a week if all it did was talk .
Frenchmen emoy conversation . They consider it an
art . They , are on the whole . skillful at . it .
We don't prize "good conversation" as much as the
French do ,
it was the brilliance . charm and imagination of Frenc h
talk that contributed niuich to the reputation of Paris as
a world center of gaiety .

three republics .
In France, as in America, there are a great many organizations (like our American Legion, VF Ws, Masons ,
tsdcl Fellows, etc .) which hold annual meetings or conventions or parades .
In France, as in any counti],v which has been liberate d
titter being under the heel of a conqueror for four years ,
there is an understandable upsurge of patriotism =. and
It desire to celebrate liberation, to honor theirmartyr s

### Cleanliness and sanitation

French hollers ,

They are . What should the French do about it ? It,
takes money to have decent plumbing . That's why s o
zru ny people in France don't have it . That's wily so marr y
people iii our own United States don't have decent plumb either .
The Germans have much better plumbing than the
French - the Germans could afford it .
Most French buildings are very old : its harder and more
expensive to install plumbing in an old house than in '
new one .
Incidentally, 9,400,000 homes in the US. do not have
electricity . 80 of. of the farmhouses do not have bath rooms and running rater . About 3,007,72 homes d o
not have private flushing toilets.

Al '' At the Polies .13crgere or the Casino de Paris, e'en the
rtshter- girls demand tips! What a, racket! "

lt. isn 't a racket. We don't think that tipping tax i
([fivers, waitresses or red caps is a "racket ".
In some theaters in France, the ushers pay for their jo b
(Ail>e our cheek-room concessions) . In most theaters the
ushers get little or no salary and depend for their live
liheod on tips . Frenchmen always tip ushers at movie
l.oirses, theaters, the Opera, symphony halls . The ushe r
wh, serves a dozen Americans who do not tip has lost the
nioiiey which a dozen Frenchmen would have given ilea' .

Why isn't there decent plumbing
toilet facilities are disgraceful I "

The

cities are filtlry.

They are certainly dirtier today than they were before
the war . The French haven't had paint for a long time .
In some cities and districts, the acute shortage o f
gasoline prevents refuse trucks from making daily rounds .

French cities and houses are a• great deal older tha n
ours ; old cities axed old houses smell more than ne w
ones .
French public sanitation, health and toilet regulation s
are certainly not on the same level as ours .
But before the war . the French washed their streets and
sidewalks more often than we do . France does not hav e
the untidy back yards . the trash dumps in empty lots ,
the tin cans and refuse in public parks that are commo n
in the - nited States .
French j omen were always scrupulous house-keepers .
But few of us eves- got . rn to see French honie .

Sanitary standards rise as the standard of living rises .
France is not as prosperous as . we are . It is not chea p
to install modern ph .uzaoing .

The French don't bathe often enough . They can't .

They don't, have real soap . They have had no soap worth y
of the name since 1940 . The Germans took the seal) ,
for four years . That 's a-long time .
The ration for Frenchman today . four months after the
war is over, is two cakes of poor ersatz soap per month - 20 grams every two months . Most real soap can onl y
be obtained on the black market, where it costs aroun d
125 francs for 31+) grams .

You smell perfume because French women would rathe r

dislike as much as you do . When you have no soap ,
perfume comes in mighty handy . In the eighteenth and

"I'd like the, French- a lot better if they were cleaner . "

That's perfectly understandable .

### Work and Laziness

49

"Why do they knock! of tcoric for two to three home ever y
day

They keep their stores open two to three hours late r
than we do . (They did when there were things to sell ;
there's no point in keeping a store open if the shelves ar e
bate. )
The long lunch hour is a custom which is not confine d
to France . It is found in It-aly= , Spain, the Balkans and
many parts of Germany . It is a custom we find annoyin g
because it interferes with our comfort (as tourists) and
because it differs from our way of doing things .
The average Frenchman maintains that a lunch eate n
at leisure is a lot better than a chicken-salad-on-toas t
gobbled down at a drugstore counter . "‘I e take time t o
live as well as work, " one Frenchman said .
The,shortage of food, the high cost of restaurant meals ,
and the fact . that only a few factories run messes make s
it necessary for the average Frenchman today to go hom e
for his lunch .
'50 " The French spend all their three at_ these sates . They
i fist sit around drinking instead of work .ting . "

The same people don't sit at the cafes all day . Watch
them come and go . They worked before they sat clow n
and they gy to wail. after they leave . Many business
negotiations are carried on at a cafe ; and many busines s
deals are concluded there .
We Americans don't approve of the cafe custom . We
don't approve of a . leisurely lunch tour, All this mean s
is that the French custom is different from ours .
The cafe is something we just don't have in the States .
It isn't a . bar. It isn't• a saloon . Its more like a club .
It's the place a man can get away from a erorcded home .
It's the place he call meet his friends . Its the place a
man tames his girl or wife and family -- to have coffee
(when they used to have coffee! . beer, wine to read the
papers . play checkers . write letters. To the French ,
the cafe is a place to relax . not a place to get drunk .
"Cafe", by the we, means coffee . Before the wa r
most of the drinking at the cafes was coffee thinking .
There is no coffee now . Blame the Germans for that ,

of an average American worker . France has far less Industrialization, mechanization . and labor-saving devices tha n
we do . That is also true of nearly all other nations in the
world.

They say they have better music, art, poetry, philosophy ,
literature . They say they take time to enjoy living .
They say they do not kill themselves iii the endless pursui t

France is not deforested because for centuries the Frenc h
have been careful to re-plant the trees they' ve cut down .
And so the rivers of France run deep all year round, and
the French soil is cool and moist, and wooden shoes com e
in mighty handy . The Frencilfarmer finds them mor e
practical than leather-shoes .

### Moral

The French women who are easy pick-ups ,are those
who are easily picked up .

the few any American has met as it would be to generaliz e
about all American women from the few a man migh t

There were, until very recently, 2,230,000 Frenchmen
in Oetnaar as PM', slave la bor . deportees .
After World War I . the young people of France streame d
from the farms to the cities . In 1930, whole villages in
some areas of Trance were deserted . Farm legislatio n
made an effort to cheek the flow of population from the
country to the cities . but it was not vein- effective .
It is, how-ever, wrong to deduce from this that the French ,
are "lazy" . Tile French farmer has always been regarde d
as one of the most industrious and thrifty in the world .
Perhaps another reason that more Frenchmen are no t
in the fields is that French people have been hided b y

130 were billed or maimed in this manner .

They don't close their eyes to it . That's the first difference between French and American attitudes towar d
;prostitution . The French recognize that prostitutio n
es sts, and regulate it . Before the war, all prostitute s
were ie inected regularly . licensed, and had their activitie s
strictly limited to specific areas . The French think tha t
legalized prostitiuon g ives health protection to the genera l
public and that the restriction of prostitution to known
areas protects decent women from being molested .
Today there is undoubtedly an abnormal . number of
prostitutes in France . 71ai.ay girls who cannot Iive o n
their wages take to the street . Thousands of Frenc h
women have lost their sweethearts, husbands, homes .
The same thing is happening all over Europe, It i s

started .

French government was drafting men to re--create a
.French army, it was found that 40 a !a of all Frenchmen

No one --- least of all the French themselves -- will
try do deny the enormity of the defeat and the humiliatio n
France suffered. ur 1940 . French military leadership and
strategy was tragically inadequate . But this does not
mean that the French did not put up a.  : real fight
In the six week Bathe of France . from May 10 to June 22 ,
1940, the French lost ; rn military personnel alone . 260,00 0
wounded and 108,064i killed . A total of 368 ;000 casualties
in six weeks is not something to pass off lightly .
Yes, the Germans gave the French a terrible beating .
But it took the combined strength of the United States ,
Great Britain, Soviet Russia, Canada, etc ., to beat the
Germans . It's asking rather a great deal of France t o
match such strength against hers . (See question § 76 .)

you might ask now German troops behaved in Poland .

If you were a French soldier, whose land had bee n

you might have found it difficult to control Your emotions .

## Prices: "We're being gypped"

"Forty

francs to a dollar is blackmoil
,north, at Inlet 100-200 francs . "

The dollar i s

The rate of 50 . francs to the dollar was established i n
1942 at the Casablanca conference . France didn 't set
the rate the rate was agreed upon .by the go irernment s
of France and the United States .
-Why was the -rate set at such a disadv-anta-ge to .the
American dolla r
First, to keep American soldiers from buying- . up Many
of the articles which the French themselves -desperatel y
needed . The American soldier gets his lodging, food ,
clothes free - and his Psi . rations at extremely low- prices ;The French people do not get their lodging, food . clothe s
free - and the prices they pay for the things we get a t
our PXs (if they can even get those things) .are eery high .
Secondly . -i.he dollar was kept low in order to keep price s
from going even higher than they are now .
If the dollar had had more purchasing power in France ,
American purchasers could have cleaned out the shop s
of, say . Paris . Prices would .be much higher than they
already are .
(Incidentally . if the dollar had been pegged at 100 francs .
say, the French private would have been getting 88 a
month pay at the wartime pay rate of 800 francs pe r
month . He would now begetting 81 .80 per month at th e
peacetime pay rate of ii francs per day .)

84

"The high prices and - inflation . era France are

a disgrace . "

Inflation is more than a disgrace - it is a tragedy. Th e
French are hit by it much harder than we are .
The basic reason for inflation, for very high prices, is the
great shortage of food and goods and things which peopl e
need and have the money to buy . When there is not
enough of anything (except money), prices go up . When
there is too much . prices go down ; when supply and
demand operate in a healthy, normal fashion, prices ar e
reasonable .
Inflation in France will end when there are enoug h
goods for all the people who want to buy= them . As long
as there are severe shortages . prices will be high .

90

"The black ma et in France

is di.sg,acetz,21 "

It. is . Most Frenchmen think it, is . too . The French
newspapers are full of daily criticism_ of the black market .
Why did the black market arise in France ? The basi c
reason for any black market, in France or in any country
at war, is that there is a great shortage of certain goods ,
which people need .
Why were (and are) there great shortages in Franc e
Largely because during four years of occupation .. the
Germans stripped France bare . picked her clean as a
bone . (In. Marseille, the food depot for the whole south.
of France, the Germans took 60 D Q of the food that wa s
being shipped in .) And when theGei'mans left they
took along everything they could lay their hands on .
There was another important reason for the blac k
market. . Daring four fears of occupation, thousand s
of French men and women who were fugitives from th e
Gestapo or' members of the resistance, had no identiiication cards and no ration cards . They could only liv e
through false papers . They could only live illegally .
They could only live by getting food and supplies - fro m
the black market . So the black market took on a quality
which we never had in the United States it becam e
patriotic for many people to patronize the black market .
It was one way of continuing to fight German rule, Qn e
way of getting supplies with which to carry on resistance .

to tell the French how to run their affairs . This much ,

France is pulling herself up by

say . ":Pull harder. It's a cinch . just pull harder . "
Lkance' is still "punch-drunk", uncertain, . demoralized

to smash the resistance movement they constantl y

## French Politics

That's as silly as saving that all American politician s
get graft. Son3e French politicians are corrupt . So
are some American politicians .
. Incidentally, the German propaganda . line for French
polities was, "All French politicians are corrupt .' The
Germans wanted the French people to lose confidenc e
in their leaders . in their government . and - iiiost o f
all -in democracy itself . The Germans ran a gigantic
smear campaign before the war. during the war . and
during the occupation . The only French politicians o f
importance whom the Germansadid ,i.oe smear were -Detain and Laval . They, said the Nazis, were not corr. rent .

The French political system Is a . democrac--y . It is
like ours in its basic principles : freedom of speech . freedoni
of religion, - freedom of the press, freedom of the vote ,
minority rights, protection under the law, trial by .jury, etc .
The system differs from ours as far as parties are eoncernea : we have a "two-nasty ' form of administration ,
the French have many parties.

The French have a political party for . allnast ever- ;.
conceivable political position . They don t believe tha t
there are two was of looking, at things " : the Frenc h
think there are dozens of ways . and that if enough people
hold to any one way they have a right to be represented_
in the Iovernm.ent .
French electoral practice has not encouraged pant ;
organisation such . as ours . The elections to the Chem ber:
of Deputies are more like our municipal (city) . elections
than our national elections . In our city elections, people
freciuently vote for their friends . anti . neighbors, - fo r
men rather than parties . This is true in France, too :
The French mutiple-party system has this advantag e
it gives even- pro-up of any size a voice in government .
a chance to get . its program considerec . a chance to ge t
certain lams passed .
The multiple-party system has this grave dis advantage
1n France . no one patty controls a majority of the vote s
in the Chamber of Deputies : Cabinets are always combination or coalition cabinets . The Frew-ter has to rel y
on persuasion . It is easy for such cabinets to be over thrown. It is relate elyr hard for such 'cabinets to worm.
together, on common program . for many years wits.
each her pr oblem or each new crisis, the cabinet can easily
be ?L•r,. i ein up .
The French today are verm.m.uch aware of the angel s
and disadvanta g es of a multiple-party system : H O
they 1T i l solve It . how they will translate wide represent -

{It, name is a carry-over from the past . )
For the ast twenty years, the great majority. of Trench i ee have ' voted for men and parties that were neithe r
-ettr°eme Left nor extreme Right ,
in the last pre-war elections of 1930 ; the par ties of the .
Poplar Frhnt (Radical Socialist, 'Socia'li t .- and Col lmualat), which . stood for a sort of _ ew Deal program .
got 382 seats in the Chamber of Deputies out of a tota l
of 30S . The parties of the Right, which opposed th e
Popular Front . got. 222 seats .
Since the liberation . the French have held miuiicipa l
elections in May 1945 and cantonal elections in Sep ter_? e.e 1943 . The voting strength of the main . partie s
in goose elections was approximately as follows

he .Fie/tat are G'oirlr,1?r,rF- et .

The Commtmist : Party got 10 seats in the Chamber o f
Deputies in the 1932 elections, and 2 out of 60S seat s

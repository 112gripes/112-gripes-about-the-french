# 112 Gripes about the French

## Foreword

AMERICANS believe in the right to criticize . We defend
our right to "beef '' or "gripe" or "sound off". We insist
upon the right to express our own opinions .
But we also believe in the right of others to express thei r
opinions. For the right to speak involves the duty to listen .
The right to criticize involves the responsibility of givin g
"the other side" a fair chance to make its point . We kno w
that the truth can only be found through open and hones t
discussion, and that the common good is served throug h
common attempts to reach common understanding, In on e
way, Democracy is the long and sometimes difficult effort
which free men make to understand each other .
This booklet tries to help some of us understand an ally the French . It is not meant either to "defend'' the Frenc h
or to chastise those Americans who do not like the French . It

## the French AND US

HT. Ve came to Europe twice .

in twenty-fee

years

to save

the French . '

We didn't come to Europe to save the French . eithe r
in 1917 or in 1944 . We didn't come to Europe to do
anyone any favors . . We came to Europe because we in
America were threatened by a hostile, aggressive and ver y
dangerous power .
In this war, France fell in June of 1940, We didn' t
invade Europe until June of 1944 . . We didn 't even think
of "saving the French" through military action until after
Peary Harbor -- after the Germans declared war on us .
We came to Europe, in two wars, because it was better
to fight our enemy- in Europe than in America . Would
it have been smarter to fight the Battle of the Bulge i n
Ohio? Would it have been smarter if D-Davhad mean t
a hop across the Atlantic Ocean, instead of the Englis h
Channel . in order to get at an enemy sending rocket bomb s
crashing into our homes Would it have been .smar t
to wait in America until V bombs, buzz bombs, rocke t
bombs, and - perhaps - atomic bombs had mad e
shambles of . our cities ? Even the kids u Germany sang
this song : "Today Germany, tomorrow the world ." We
were a part of that world . We were marked for conquest .
When France fell, our last defense on the Continen t
was gone . France was the "keystone of freedom " on
land from the Mediterranean to the North Sea ; it was •. a
bulwark against German aggression . France guarded

the Atlantic, and the bases the Germans needed on th e
Atlantic for submarine and air warfare .
American security and American foreign policy hav e
always rested on this hard fact we cannot permit a hostile power on the Atlantic Ocean . We cannot be secur e
if we are threatened on the Atlantic . That's why w e
went to war in 1917 ; that ' s why we had to fight in 1944 .
And that's wh y, as a matter of common sense and th e
national interest, President Roosevelt declared (November 11 . 1941) : "The defense of any territory under th e
control of the "French Volunteer Forces (the Free Trench )
is vital to the defense of the United States : "

- Perhaps the French ran out of wine, cheese, fruit an d

They don't have the food. (The Germans took it . )
They don't ' speak English and we don't speak . French.
It's hard to extend hospitality under those conditions .

You don't have. to love the French . You don't hav e
to hate them either . You might try to understand them ,
The more important point is not to let your feeling blin d
you to the fact that they Were and . are our tallies, They
were in 1917, toe .
The most important questionnny people can . ask itself
is this . "Who fights with us 2. Who fights against us ?" .

It was inevitable that some Frenchmen would rub som e
Americans the wrong ray= . City people often rub country
folk the wrong «ay the same goes for a Pittsburgher in
New Orleans . or +.Texan on Fifth Avenue .
We Americans believe in the value of differences ---- z r
:basic political beliefs and goals rest on a common foundation . (See question § 6'9 .)

They did . They helped us out of one of the greates t
jams •e were ever in . During the American revolution,
when almost the entire world stood by m "non intervention" or was against us, it was France who was our greates t
ally and benefactor. France loaned the thirteen state s
56 .400,000 - and score us over S3,000,000 more . (That
was a lot more money in those days than it is now . )
45,000 Frenchmen volunteered in the array of Georg e
Washin ton, They crossed the Atlantic Ocean in small .
boats that took two months to make the voyage .
Washington s `army had no military engineers ; it was
French engineers who designed and built our 'fortifications .
The name. of Lafayette is one that Americans will neve r
forget, and the French are as proud of that name 'as w e
are.
g

You can judge the measure and meaning of French ai d
to our Revolution from the letter George Washington sen t
on April 9, 1781 to our military envoy . in Paris, askin g
for help from Franc e
"We are at this hour suspended in the balance no t
from choice but from hard and absolute necessity . . . Our
troops are fast approaching nakedness . . . our hospitals
are without medicines and our sick without nutrition _
in a word, we are at the end of our tether, and ... now or
never our . deliverance must cone . "
It was France that came to our aid in our darkest hour .
7

T'Ve can't rely on these French . "
That depends on what you mean by "rely" . If yo u
expect the French to react like Americans, you will b e
disappointed . They are not Americans they are French .
If you expect the French to hurry the way we do . you
will be disappointed the French don't hurry ---neithe r
do most of the people i t the world outside of America .
But we were able to rely on the French for the most
important thing France fought with is, not against us ,
twice in the past two decades ,

e

"W E'ee had more

beEd n i from the French than from th e
Germans . We are always quarreling with them . The y
criticize. eeerythin .g . They have to put gent taro cents
in . Bat the Germans - they / fist ddo wlmt you tel l
them to . They're co-operative ; the. 1',tench aren't . "

Two men working together are more likely to tell . each
other oil than a prisoner is to tell off the warden .
Of course we differ with the French ; of course we argue
with them . Why ? Because we have a common goa l
and face common problems . Because we, like the French,
have been taught to think for.. ourselves, to "put our . two
cents in". Democracy is based on the -idea that everyone
has a basic right to pint his two cents in" . In Americ a
we say, "I'm from Missouri" or "Sez who ?" The Frenc h
have the'same attitude they say, "Je aie crois q'ee cep qu e
hois " . ("I only believe what I see . " ) Or "Je 7zE demard e
("I don't ask much . ;
pas rnae er Tue d'etre co-nramev
I just want, to he convinced," )
There is a saying that in France everything is permitte d
that is not strictly forbidden - but in Germany ever y
thing is verboten. that is not strictly permitted, We
are in the French, not the German ; tradition .
Yes, we quarrel with the French. The members of a
family argue pretty freely inside the home ; We quarre l
with our allies, We don't quarrel with our enemies -- we fight them .
As for the Germans, they've gat to be "co-operative" .
They have no choice . Theyre under military law .
Which is better a critical ally or a fawning enemy ?
Flatterers are the worst land of enemies,'' - Tacitus .

We didn't give the French these things . Weileaat them ,
under Lend-Leaser a law passed by our Congress as "A n

Where else could the French have gotten uniforms ,

Under Lend-Lease we provided military supplies an d

Under reverse Lend-Lease, the French have alread y

paid back about 5150,000, 000 - almost half of the amoun
we lent them ua the way of military supplies .

"The French welcomed ns at first ;° now they want v s

An American kI recently said, "We re like people wh o
were given a wonderful reception for a week-end . But
we've stave;-i . in the house for a year . No one wants a .
house guest that long .' '
Of course the French would prefer that American troop s
1' leave France as soon as possible . (So would you, if yo u
were a Frenchman .) As long as we are here, we Impos e
an added strain on the already overtaxed French economy . The French need the billets and food andsupplie s

you don't hear any Americans passing out bouquet s

18

" The. french: let-us down . -when the fighting got tough .
What di' they do - as fighters - to help us out ? "

Here are a few of the things the French did
The French fought in Africa,-in Sicily, liberated Corsica ,
fought in Italy, took past in the invasion of Europe an d
fought through the battles of France and Germany - fro m
Normandy to Munich.

Units from the French navy participated iri'tl the invasion s
of Sicily, -Italy, Normandy and South France .
Units of the French navy and merchant marine too k
part in convoying operations on the Atlantic and Mt inansk routes ,
'-,,7. June 5 1.944 the day° before D-Darr, over 5,000 Wren .:
clifnen of the . resistance d'ynami'ted railroads in more tha n
500 strategic places.
They delayed strategic German troop movements fo r
an average of 48 hours, . according-to our-niilitaryexperts .
Those 48 . hours were tact-lea-11y priceless ° they saved a n
untold number of American lives .
French resistance groups hew up a series of bridges
in southern France and delayed one of the Wehrmacht' s
crack units Was Reich Panzer Division) for tae .7ze- day s
in getting from Bordeaux to Normandy .
About 30,000 FFI troups supported the Third Army' s
VIII Corps in-Brittany : they seized and held key spots ;
they conducted extensive •guerrilla operations behind th e
German lines .
25,000 FFI troops protected the south flank of ,the
Third Army in its daring dash across France the EFT '
wiped-out -Germanbridgeheads . north of the Loire Rive r
they guarded vital lines of communication , they wipe d
out pockets of German resistance , they held many town s
and cities under orders from our command .
When our Third Army was approaching the area between Dijon and Troyes from the west, and while the
Seventh Army was approaching this sector from the

South, it was the FFI who stubbornly . blocked the German s
from making a stand and prevented- a mass retirement o f
.German troops .
In Paris . as our armies drew close, several hundred thous and French men and women rose . up against the Germans .
!50,000 armed men of the . resistance fought and beat the
Nazi garrison . and occupied the main buildings and administrative offices of Paris .
These are some of the things the French did . For others,
see question § 104 .

"They

by our government .

Some Frenchmen are other Frenchmen are not .
The French as a whole are not as "hail fellow well met"
as we Americans are, Neither are the British, the Swedes ,
the Greeks, the Mexicans . -Frenchmen don't get personal or confidential quickly .

They don'tc` ; open up" as quickly as we do in the States .
The French are very polite they are also more formal tha n
we are. about personal relationships . (So are the Chinese . )
The French respect . another person 's privacy, and they
like to have their own privacy respected too . It is natur ri tor anyone to think the people of anothe r
nation are note as friendly as' his own people . It's har d
to be friendly in a foreign language . It's hard to 'be
friendly 'when you're hungry, cold, and have gone throug h
six years of war - as the French have . Yet- the Americans who came into Normandy, Or who came into Pari s
fight after the liberation, still talk about the astonishing
outburst of g ratitude, generosity and friendliness whic h
the French displayed toward us . Back in the States, many of our troops complained tha t
the people in the towns near the training camps were no t
friendly . People from our South often complain tha t
the . people in the North are not friendly . A Texan in
Vermont 'finds New Englanders- cold" and " snobbish''' .
Do we then say that all Americans are unfriendly
Friendship, said a wise Man, lies in this : "To desire the .
same things and to reject the same things ." On this
basis, the United States has never hid , a better frien d
than France : (See question § 69 .)'

" Why bother about the ,reach ? They cavil thro w
any weight fit the post-cat .'r world . "
Apart from reasons of honor and simple decency Amer 76

leans are not in the habit of letting their friends (Io g;-n) ,
it is poor politics and worse diplomacy to "--rite off " a
nation of 40 million allies . Yeti may need their hel p

France still stands as a bastion on ±1 A lautie . fro m
the IN'Ieditcrrznean to the North Sea . France will stil l
he a strong factor in world political- organization . Th e
island bases of France, and her colonies, will still be strae
tegic areas 'fi the world structure of peace . And in thn
and
populatio
aye of the atomic bomb, the physical size
of a country may be no index of her strong h. and poten tialities .
Why bother about France .2 It is not our job to "bothe r
about " France . But it is our job to be .seriously concerne d.
about the peace and the political problems of the world
.
France is very much a part of that world .
David Low, the English . cartoonist, once drew a famou s
cartoon showing the nations in a larg e rowboat . Th e
European nations war e at one end of the boat, which wa s
foundering in the water Uncle g am sat m the other end ,
high and dry and out of the water . And Uncle Sam was
saying . "Why should I worry i The leak isn't in my en dg
of the boat !" We have paid a terrible price for believin
that a leak "at the other end of the boat " does not' affec t
our destiny .

### A. Characterestics

The French think that the American soldier who sell s
cigarettes, soap or candy on the black market at fantasti c
prices is mercenary . Some Americans will "do anythin g
for a couple of hundred francs'" .

Some Frenchmen have certainly gypped some Americans .

We remember the times we were gypped . We forge t

"The

"

The French are disillusioned . . . They are hitter . They
have a right to be . They have gone through six of th e
most disastrous years of history . They have experience d
defeat, . hunge r; persecution, invasion, occupation . despair .
They have been humiliated before the eyes of the world .
The cynical comments which many of us have heard i n
France are a reflection of the profound shock and confusion
the French have surdered for the past six years .
Cynical talk, by the was is often considered "smart "
andy "sophisticated " -; in the United States no less tha n
in France . We Americans love to give the "low- down ° ;
we love to tell "the inside story ' . So do the Freneli.
But the French are not cynical about certain things ,
about ideas like "Liberty, Equality . Fraternity" . They
mean it, They have always fought" for it .

27 "The, Trcnch are "n-ct up-to-date .
They re ha:mg . in the past . "

Change comes slowly in France . On the whole . the
French are conservative . If the average Frenchman ha s
a secure living, he is satisfied . His dream is not to becom e
a millionaire, but to retire on a "little" fortune so that he
can have a "little" home and a "little" garden and rea d

The French are certainly not highly industrialized a s
we are. Compared to some other nations, however, they
are considered very up-to-date . Tt depends on what standard you use . The French are as far advanced as an y

music. design, silk manufacture, textiles, etc .
The World _Almanac for 1945 concludes that as far a s
social legislation is concerned, "France is iif the vanguard" ..
The French were certainly up-to-date in establishing old

was France that introduced the forty-hour work week .

Are the French : :insincere " ? The way to answer thi s

of Frenchmen who show these characteristics, compar e
this number to the number of Frenchmen who do no t

### B. Customs and Manners

It is always something of a shock when you ran int o
different ways of talking, eating, doing things . But what
is different is not always inferior . "different " does not ,
mean "worse" . There is more than one way of skinnin g
a cat .
The story is told of an American soldier who saw som e
Chinese putting rice on the graves in a Chungking cemetery . That doesn't make sense", said the American wit h

A11 the French do is talk .

No nation could exist for a week if all it did was talk .
Frenchmen emoy conversation . They consider it an
art . They , are on the whole . skillful at . it .
We don't prize "good conversation" as much as th e
French do ,
it was the brilliance . charm and imagination of Frenc h
talk that contributed niuich to the reputation of Paris as
a world center of gaiety .

three republics .
In France, as in America, there are a great many organizations (like our American Legion, VF Ws, Masons ,
tsdcl Fellows, etc .) which hold annual meetings or conventions or parades .
In France, as in any counti],v which has been liberate d
titter being under the heel of a conqueror for four years ,
there is an understandable upsurge of patriotism =. and
It desire to celebrate liberation, to honor theirmartyr s

### Cleanliness and sanitation

French hollers ,

They are . What should the French do about it ? It,
takes money to have decent plumbing . That's why s o
zru ny people in France don't have it . That's wily so marr y
people iii our own United States don't have decent plumb either .
The Germans have much better plumbing than th e
French - the Germans could afford it .
Most French buildings are very old : its harder and more
expensive to install plumbing in an old house than in '
new one .
Incidentally, 9,400,000 homes in the US. do not have
electricity . 80 of. of the farmhouses do not have bath rooms and running rater . About 3,007,72 homes d o
not have private flushing toilets.

Al '' At the Polies .13crgere or the Casino de Paris, e'en th e
rtshter- girls demand tips! What a, racket! "

lt. isn 't a racket. We don't think that tipping tax i
([fivers, waitresses or red caps is a "racket ".
In some theaters in France, the ushers pay for their jo b
(Ail>e our cheek-room concessions) . In most theaters th e
ushers get little or no salary and depend for their live
liheod on tips . Frenchmen always tip ushers at movie
l.oirses, theaters, the Opera, symphony halls . The ushe r
wh, serves a dozen Americans who do not tip has lost the
nioiiey which a dozen Frenchmen would have given ilea' .

Why isn't there decent plumbing
toilet facilities are disgraceful I "

The

cities are filtlry.

They are certainly dirtier today than they were before
the war . The French haven't had paint for a long time .
In some cities and districts, the acute shortage o f
gasoline prevents refuse trucks from making daily rounds .

French cities and houses are a• great deal older tha n
ours ; old cities axed old houses smell more than ne w
ones .
French public sanitation, health and toilet regulation s
are certainly not on the same level as ours .
But before the war . the French washed their streets an d
sidewalks more often than we do . France does not hav e
the untidy back yards . the trash dumps in empty lots ,
the tin cans and refuse in public parks that are commo n
in the - nited States .

for four years . That 's a-long time .
The ration for Frenchman today . four months after th e
war is over, is two cakes of poor ersatz soap per month - 20 grams every two months . Most real soap can onl y
be obtained on the black market, where it costs aroun d
125 francs for 31+) grams .

perfume comes in mighty handy . In the eighteenth an d

"Why do they knock! of tcoric for two to three home ever y
day

They keep their stores open two to three hours late r
than we do . (They did when there were things to sell ;
there's no point in keeping a store open if the shelves ar e
bate. )
The long lunch hour is a custom which is not confine d
to France . It is found in It-aly= , Spain, the Balkans an d
many parts of Germany . It is a custom we find annoyin g
because it interferes with our comfort (as tourists) and
because it differs from our way of doing things .
The average Frenchman maintains that a lunch eate n
at leisure is a lot better than a chicken-salad-on-toas t
gobbled down at a drugstore counter . "‘I e take time t o
live as well as work, " one Frenchman said .
The,shortage of food, the high cost of restaurant meals ,
and the fact . that only a few factories run messes make s
it necessary for the average Frenchman today to go hom e
for his lunch .
'50 " The French spend all their three at_ these sates . They
i fist sit around drinking instead of work .ting . "

The same people don't sit at the cafes all day . Watch
them come and go . They worked before they sat clow n
and they gy to wail. after they leave . Many business
negotiations are carried on at a cafe ; and many busines s
deals are concluded there .
We Americans don't approve of the cafe custom . We
don't approve of a . leisurely lunch tour, All this mean s
is that the French custom is different from ours .
The cafe is something we just don't have in the States .
It isn't a . bar. It isn't• a saloon . Its more like a club .
It's the place a man can get away from a erorcded home .
It's the place he call meet his friends . Its the place a
man tames his girl or wife and family -- to have coffee
(when they used to have coffee! . beer, wine to read the
papers . play checkers . write letters. To the French ,
the cafe is a place to relax . not a place to get drunk .
"Cafe", by the we, means coffee . Before the wa r
most of the drinking at the cafes was coffee thinking .
There is no coffee now . Blame the Germans for that ,

of an average American worker . France has far less Industrialization, mechanization . and labor-saving devices tha n
we do . That is also true of nearly all other nations in th e
world.
The French claim they get . more out of life than we do .
They say they have better music, art, poetry, philosophy ,
literature . They say they take time to enjoy living .
They say they do not kill themselves iii the endless pursui t
of money-.

in mighty handy . The Frencilfarmer finds them mor e
practical than leather-shoes .

There were, until very recently, 2,230,000 Frenchmen
in Oetnaar as PM', slave la bor . deportees .
After World War I . the young people of France streame d
from the farms to the cities . In 1930, whole villages in
some areas of Trance were deserted . Farm legislatio n
made an effort to cheek the flow of population from th e
country to the cities . but it was not vein- effective .
It is, how-ever, wrong to deduce from this that the French ,
are "lazy" . Tile French farmer has always been regarde d
as one of the most industrious and thrifty in the world .
Perhaps another reason that more Frenchmen are no t
in the fields is that French people have been hided b y

They don't close their eyes to it . That's the first difference between French and American attitudes towar d
;prostitution . The French recognize that prostitutio n
es sts, and regulate it . Before the war, all prostitute s
were ie inected regularly . licensed, and had their activitie s
strictly limited to specific areas . The French think tha t
legalized prostitiuon g ives health protection to the genera l
public and that the restriction of prostitution to known
areas protects decent women from being molested .
Today there is undoubtedly an abnormal . number of
prostitutes in France . 71ai.ay girls who cannot Iive o n
their wages take to the street . Thousands of Frenc h
women have lost their sweethearts, husbands, homes .
The same thing is happening all over Europe, It i s
another of the appalling consequences of the war German y
started .

No one --- least of all the French themselves -- will

France suffered. ur 1940 . French military leadership an d
strategy was tragically inadequate . But this does not
mean that the French did not put up a. ` : real fight

Yes, the Germans gave the French a terrible beating .
But it took the combined strength of the United States ,
Great Britain, Soviet Russia, Canada, etc ., to beat the
Germans . It's asking rather a great deal of France t o
match such strength against hers . (See question § 76 .)

"Forty

francs to a dollar is blackmoil
,north, at Inlet 100-200 francs . "

The dollar i s

The rate of 50 . francs to the dollar was established i n
1942 at the Casablanca conference . France didn 't set
the rate the rate was agreed upon .by the go irernment s
of France and the United States .
-Why was the -rate set at such a disadv-anta-ge to .the
American dolla r
First, to keep American soldiers from buying- . up Many
of the articles which the French themselves -desperatel y
needed . The American soldier gets his lodging, food ,
clothes free - and his Psi . rations at extremely low- prices ;The French people do not get their lodging, food . clothe s
free - and the prices they pay for the things we get a t
our PXs (if they can even get those things) .are eery high .
Secondly . -i.he dollar was kept low in order to keep price s
from going even higher than they are now .
If the dollar had had more purchasing power in France ,
American purchasers could have cleaned out the shop s
of, say . Paris . Prices would .be much higher than they
already are .
(Incidentally . if the dollar had been pegged at 100 francs .
say, the French private would have been getting 88 a
month pay at the wartime pay rate of 800 francs pe r
month . He would now begetting 81 .80 per month at th e
peacetime pay rate of ii francs per day .)

84

"The high prices and - inflation . era France are

a disgrace . "

Inflation is more than a disgrace - it is a tragedy. Th e
French are hit by it much harder than we are .
The basic reason for inflation, for very high prices, is the
great shortage of food and goods and things which peopl e
need and have the money to buy . When there is not
enough of anything (except money), prices go up . When
there is too much . prices go down ; when supply and
demand operate in a healthy, normal fashion, prices ar e
reasonable .
Inflation in France will end when there are enoug h
goods for all the people who want to buy= them . As long
as there are severe shortages . prices will be high .

"The black ma et in France

is di.sg,acetz,21 "

It. is . Most Frenchmen think it, is . too . The French
newspapers are full of daily criticism_ of the black market .
Why did the black market arise in France ? The basi c
reason for any black market, in France or in any country
at war, is that there is a great shortage of certain goods ,
which people need .
Why were (and are) there great shortages in Franc e
Largely because during four years of occupation .. the
Germans stripped France bare . picked her clean as a
bone . (In. Marseille, the food depot for the whole south.
of France, the Germans took 60 D Q of the food that wa s
being shipped in .) And when theGei'mans left they
took along everything they could lay their hands on .
There was another important reason for the blac k
market. . Daring four fears of occupation, thousand s
of French men and women who were fugitives from th e
Gestapo or' members of the resistance, had no identiiication cards and no ration cards . They could only liv e
through false papers . They could only live illegally .
They could only live by getting food and supplies - fro m
the black market . So the black market took on a quality
which we never had in the United States it becam e
patriotic for many people to patronize the black market .
It was one way of continuing to fight German rule, Qn e
way of getting supplies with which to carry on resistance .

This is the exact argument used by Dr . Gcehbcis an d

## French Politics

That's as silly as saving that all American politician s
get graft. Son3e French politicians are corrupt . So
are some American politicians .
. Incidentally, the German propaganda . line for French
polities was, "All French politicians are corrupt .' The
Germans wanted the French people to lose confidenc e
in their leaders . in their government . and - iiiost o f
all -in democracy itself . The Germans ran a gigantic
smear campaign before the war. during the war . and
during the occupation . The only French politicians o f
importance whom the Germansadid ,i.oe smear were -Detain and Laval . They, said the Nazis, were not corr. rent .

The French political system Is a . democrac--y . It is
like ours in its basic principles : freedom of speech . freedoni
of religion, - freedom of the press, freedom of the vote ,
minority rights, protection under the law, trial by .jury, etc .
The system differs from ours as far as parties are eoncernea : we have a "two-nasty ' form of administration ,
the French have many parties.

The French have a political party for . allnast ever- ;.
conceivable political position . They don t believe tha t
there are two was of looking, at things " : the Frenc h
think there are dozens of ways . and that if enough people
hold to any one way they have a right to be represented_
in the Iovernm.ent .
French electoral practice has not encouraged pant ;
organisation such . as ours . The elections to the Chem ber:
of Deputies are more like our municipal (city) . elections
than our national elections . In our city elections, people
freciuently vote for their friends . anti . neighbors, - fo r
men rather than parties . This is true in France, too :
The French mutiple-party system has this advantag e
it gives even- pro-up of any size a voice in government .
a chance to get . its program considerec . a chance to ge t
certain lams passed .
The multiple-party system has this grave dis advantage
1n France . no one patty controls a majority of the vote s
in the Chamber of Deputies : Cabinets are always combination or coalition cabinets . The Frew-ter has to rel y
on persuasion . It is easy for such cabinets to be over thrown. It is relate elyr hard for such 'cabinets to worm.
together, on common program . for many years wits.
each her pr oblem or each new crisis, the cabinet can easily
be ?L•r,. i ein up .
The French today are verm.m.uch aware of the angel s
and disadvanta g es of a multiple-party system : H O

iowe' Middle-class it is a middle-of-the-road party.
{It, name is a carry-over from the past . )
For the ast twenty years, the great majority. of Trench i ee have ' voted for men and parties that were neithe r
-ettr°eme Left nor extreme Right ,
in the last pre-war elections of 1930 ; the par ties of the .
Poplar Frhnt (Radical Socialist, 'Socia'li t .- and Col lmualat), which . stood for a sort of _ ew Deal program .
got 382 seats in the Chamber of Deputies out of a tota l
of 30S . The parties of the Right, which opposed th e
Popular Front . got. 222 seats .
Since the liberation . the French have held miuiicipa l
elections in May 1945 and cantonal elections in Sep ter_? e.e 1943 . The voting strength of the main . partie s
in goose elections was approximately as follows

he .Fie/tat are G'oirlr,1?r,rF- et .

The Commtmist : Party got 10 seats in the Chamber o f
Deputies in the 1932 elections, and 2 out of 60S seat s
